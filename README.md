# Digital Logic Labs
This repository includes the labs and reports for which I had completed in a Digital Logic Laboratory course. These range from the simplest of concepts within VHDL for simple implementations, to multiple state machine designs for later projects and other concepts such as PWMs, Memory, and Timing Analysis.
